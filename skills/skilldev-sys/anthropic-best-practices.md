# Skill authoring best practices

> Learn how to write effective Skills that Claude can discover and use successfully.

Good Skills are concise, well-structured, and tested with real usage. This guide provides practical authoring decisions to help you write Skills that Claude can discover and use effectively.

For conceptual background on how Skills work, see the [Skills overview](/en/docs/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/overview).

## Core principles

### Concise is key

The [context window](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/context-windows) is a public good. Your Skill shares the context window with everything else Claude needs to know, including:

* The system prompt
* Conversation history
* Other Skills' metadata
* Your actual request

Not every token in your Skill has an immediate cost. At startup, only the metadata (name and description) from all Skills is pre-loaded. Claude reads SKILL.md only when the Skill becomes relevant, and reads additional files only as needed. However, being concise in SKILL.md still matters: once Claude loads it, every token competes with conversation history and other context.

**Default assumption**: Claude is already very smart

Only add context Claude doesn't already have. Challenge each piece of information:

* "Does Claude really need this explanation?"
* "Can I assume Claude knows this?"
* "Does this paragraph justify its token cost?"

**Good example: Concise** (approximately 50 tokens):

````markdown  theme={null}
## Extract PDF text

Use pdfplumber for text extraction:

```python
import pdfplumber

with pdfplumber.open("file.pdf") as pdf:
    text = pdf.pages[0].extract_text()
```
````

**Bad example: Too verbose** (approximately 150 tokens):

```markdown  theme={null}
## Extract PDF text

PDF (Portable Document Format) files are a common file format that contains
text, images, and other content. To extract text from a PDF, you'll need to
use a library. There are many libraries available for PDF processing, but we
recommend pdfplumber because it's easy to use and handles most cases well.
First, you'll need to install it using pip. Then you can use the code below...
```

The concise version assumes Claude knows what PDFs are and how libraries work.

### Set appropriate degrees of freedom

Match the level of specificity to the task's fragility and variability.

**High freedom** (text-based instructions):

Use when:

* Multiple approaches are valid
* Decisions depend on context
* Heuristics guide the approach

Example:

```markdown  theme={null}
## Code review process

1. Analyze the code structure and organization
2. Check for potential bugs or edge cases
3. Suggest improvements for readability and maintainability
4. Verify adherence to project conventions
```

**Medium freedom** (pseudocode or scripts with parameters):

Use when:

* A preferred pattern exists
* Some variation is acceptable
* Configuration affects behavior

Example:

````markdown  theme={null}
## Generate report

Use this template and customize as needed:

```python
def generate_report(data, format="markdown", include_charts=True):
    # Process data
    # Generate output in specified format
    # Optionally include visualizations
```
````

**Low freedom** (specific scripts, few or no parameters):

Use when:

* Operations are fragile and error-prone
* Consistency is critical
* A specific sequence must be followed

Example:

````markdown  theme={null}
## Database migration

Run exactly this script:

```bash
python scripts/migrate.py --verify --backup
```

Do not modify the command or add additional flags.
````

**Analogy**: Think of Claude as a robot exploring a path:

* **Narrow bridge with cliffs on both sides**: There's only one safe way forward. Provide specific guardrails and exact instructions (low freedom). Example: database migrations that must run in exact sequence.
* **Open field with no hazards**: Many paths lead to success. Give general direction and trust Claude to find the best route (high freedom). Example: code reviews where context determines the best approach.

### Test with all models you plan to use

Skills act as additions to models, so effectiveness depends on the underlying model. Test your Skill with all the models you plan to use it with.

**Testing considerations by model**:

* **Claude Haiku** (fast, economical): Does the Skill provide enough guidance?
* **Claude Sonnet** (balanced): Is the Skill clear and efficient?
* **Claude Opus** (powerful reasoning): Does the Skill avoid over-explaining?

What works perfectly for Opus might need more detail for Haiku. If you plan to use your Skill across multiple models, aim for instructions that work well with all of them.

## Skill structure

**YAML Frontmatter**: The SKILL.md frontmatter supports two fields:

* `name` - Human-readable name of the Skill (64 characters maximum)
* `description` - One-line description of what the Skill does and when to use it (1024 characters maximum)

### Naming conventions

Use consistent naming patterns to make Skills easier to reference and discuss. We recommend using **gerund form** (verb + -ing) for Skill names, as this clearly describes the activity or capability the Skill provides.

**Good naming examples (gerund form)**:

* "Processing PDFs"
* "Analyzing spreadsheets"
* "Managing databases"
* "Testing code"
* "Writing documentation"

**Acceptable alternatives**:

* Noun phrases: "PDF Processing", "Spreadsheet Analysis"
* Action-oriented: "Process PDFs", "Analyze Spreadsheets"

**Avoid**:

* Vague names: "Helper", "Utils", "Tools"
* Overly generic: "Documents", "Data", "Files"
* Inconsistent patterns within your skill collection

### Writing effective descriptions

The `description` field enables Skill discovery and should include both what the Skill does and when to use it.

**Always write in third person**. The description is injected into the system prompt, and inconsistent point-of-view can cause discovery problems.

* **Good:** "Processes Excel files and generates reports"
* **Avoid:** "I can help you process Excel files"
* **Avoid:** "You can use this to process Excel files"

**Be specific and include key terms**. Include both what the Skill does and specific triggers/contexts for when to use it.

### Progressive disclosure patterns

SKILL.md serves as an overview that points Claude to detailed materials as needed, like a table of contents in an onboarding guide.

**Practical guidance:**

* Keep SKILL.md body under 500 lines for optimal performance
* Split content into separate files when approaching this limit
* Use the patterns below to organize instructions, code, and resources effectively

#### Pattern 1: High-level guide with references

````markdown  theme={null}
---
name: PDF Processing
description: Extracts text and tables from PDF files, fills forms, and merges documents. Use when working with PDF files or when the user mentions PDFs, forms, or document extraction.
---

# PDF Processing

## Quick start

Extract text with pdfplumber:
```python
import pdfplumber
with pdfplumber.open("file.pdf") as pdf:
    text = pdf.pages[0].extract_text()
```

## Advanced features

**Form filling**: See [FORMS.md](FORMS.md) for complete guide
**API reference**: See [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md) for all methods
**Examples**: See [EXAMPLES.md](EXAMPLES.md) for common patterns
````

Claude loads FORMS.md, REFERENCE.md, or EXAMPLES.md only when needed.

#### Pattern 2: Domain-specific organization

For Skills with multiple domains, organize content by domain to avoid loading irrelevant context.

```
bigquery-skill/
  SKILL.md (overview and navigation)
  reference/
    finance.md (revenue, billing metrics)
    sales.md (opportunities, pipeline)
    product.md (API usage, features)
    marketing.md (campaigns, attribution)
```

#### Pattern 3: Conditional details

Show basic content, link to advanced content:

```markdown  theme={null}
# DOCX Processing

## Creating documents

Use docx-js for new documents. See [DOCX-JS.md](DOCX-JS.md).

## Editing documents

For simple edits, modify the XML directly.

**For tracked changes**: See [REDLINING.md](REDLINING.md)
**For OOXML details**: See [OOXML.md](OOXML.md)
```

### Avoid deeply nested references

Claude may partially read files when they're referenced from other referenced files. **Keep references one level deep from SKILL.md**.

### Structure longer reference files with table of contents

For reference files longer than 100 lines, include a table of contents at the top.

## Workflows and feedback loops

### Use workflows for complex tasks

Break complex operations into clear, sequential steps. For particularly complex workflows, provide a checklist that Claude can copy into its response and check off as it progresses.

### Implement feedback loops

**Common pattern**: Run validator -> fix errors -> repeat

This pattern greatly improves output quality.

## Content guidelines

### Avoid time-sensitive information

Don't include information that will become outdated.

### Use consistent terminology

Choose one term and use it throughout the Skill.

## Common patterns

### Template pattern

Provide templates for output format. Match the level of strictness to your needs.

### Examples pattern

For Skills where output quality depends on seeing examples, provide input/output pairs.

### Conditional workflow pattern

Guide Claude through decision points.

## Evaluation and iteration

### Build evaluations first

**Create evaluations BEFORE writing extensive documentation.** This ensures your Skill solves real problems rather than documenting imagined ones.

### Develop Skills iteratively with Claude

The most effective Skill development process involves Claude itself. Work with one instance of Claude ("Claude A") to create a Skill that will be used by other instances ("Claude B").

### Observe how Claude navigates Skills

Pay attention to how Claude actually uses Skills in practice. Iterate based on observations rather than assumptions.

## Anti-patterns to avoid

### Avoid Windows-style paths

Always use forward slashes in file paths, even on Windows.

### Avoid offering too many options

Don't present multiple approaches unless necessary. Provide a default with escape hatch.

## Advanced: Skills with executable code

### Solve, don't punt

When writing scripts for Skills, handle error conditions rather than punting to Claude.

### Provide utility scripts

Even if Claude could write a script, pre-made scripts offer advantages: more reliable, save tokens, save time, ensure consistency.

### Use visual analysis

When inputs can be rendered as images, have Claude analyze them.

### Create verifiable intermediate outputs

Use the "plan-validate-execute" pattern to catch errors early.

### Package dependencies

List required packages in your SKILL.md and verify they're available.

### Runtime environment

Skills run in a code execution environment with filesystem access, bash commands, and code execution capabilities.

### MCP tool references

If your Skill uses MCP tools, always use fully qualified tool names: `ServerName:tool_name`.

### Avoid assuming tools are installed

Don't assume packages are available. Be explicit about dependencies.
